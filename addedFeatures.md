# Added Features: 
  
  ### One of the features added was the issue #27. In this feature, we implemented the: 
  
  The feature was implemented over two different merge requests, with two separate people working on it. The merge requests
  used were https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a02/group-8/app/-/merge_requests/9 and https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a02/group-8/app/-/merge_requests/13. 
  
  These are the user stories associated with #27, that **were** implemented in this feature: 
  * #4
  * * #19 
    
    These are the user stories **originally** associated with #27, that **were not** implemented in this feature: 
    
    * #2
    * * #10
    * * #17
# The reasoning behind this, is that we felt that the feature was too large, and should be split into smaller chunks. So we transition some of the user stories off of this feature. With the current implementation we have the base of this feature, which is browsing and selecting movies given a criteria (theatre, time)
