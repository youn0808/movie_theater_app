# Vision statement 
We have chosen to build a movie ticket purchasing application for our project. Our users will be able to purchase and reserve movie tickets through an app before going to the theater.

## What is it?
Our movie ticket purchasing app is a one-stop-shop to purchase movie tickets at our user's convenience. The app stores useful information such as the latest movie releases, theater locations, airing times as well as ratings. Before purchasing, users can also see trailers for a movie and make an informed decision. Additionally, our users will be able to choose their preferred sitting area as long as it’s empty. After purchasing a movie ticket, users will receive their receipt through email and provide it at the theater. The app also contains a discount system for loyal customers. 

## Who is it for?
Our movie ticket purchasing app is primarily for individuals looking to buy a movie ticket at their preferred location. They require minimal knowledge as our app will be intuitive. Since our app would require some kind of payment method, the primary users will be young adults and adults. Our app can also be used by theaters to add and remove certain movies from their listing. Based on current demand at the theater, they can provide discounts on movies. 

## Why is it valuable?
The movie ticket purchasing app is an improvement from the traditional ways of purchasing a movie ticket. Users are not required to drive to the theater and wait long lines to purchase their tickets before the movie air time. Nowadays, moviegoers require a more contactless and convenient way of purchasing movie tickets online. This will improve their experience in general because they’ll have all the information they need in one place before making a purchase. Many users value their time therefore the simplistic and intuitive design of our app will be a great benefit. In addition, the app is also valuable to theaters as it can assist in attracting new and loyal users by promoting it via AppStore or Google Play. Consequently, increasing theater revenues. 

## How will it be successful?
The app’s success is primarily measured by its ease of use. Hence, it will enable theaters to sell 50% more tickets compared to traditional methods. With our design, we will be able to reduce the user's cognitive workload and require less attention to complete a simple step. Therefore, our conversion rate will increase while providing good service. In addition, our loyalty program will provide our returning users with discounts for their next purchase. This will incentivise our users to use our app often and even tell family or friends about it.
